/*Problem statement
Queue is a linear data structure that follows the idea of First In First Out. That means insertion and retrieval operations happen at opposite ends.
Implement a simple queue using arrays.
You are given 'query' queries which are either of the 2 types:
1 'e': Enqueue (add) element ‘e’ at the end of the queue.
2: Dequeue (retrieve) the element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1. */

class Queue {

	int front, rear;
	vector<int> arr;

public:
	Queue()
	{
		front = 0;
		rear = 0;
		arr.resize(100001);
	}

	// Enqueue (add) element 'e' at the end of the queue.
	void enqueue(int e)
	{
		arr[rear] = e;
		rear++;
	}

	// Dequeue (retrieve) the element from the front of the queue.
	int dequeue()
	{
		if(rear != front)
		{
			return arr[front++];
		}
		return -1;
	}
};
